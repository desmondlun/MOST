	<p align="center">MOST Version 2.0 alpha-9 has been released on January 8, 2018.
	<a href="#dates">View release history</a>.
	</p>

	<p align=center><a href="MOST_v2_alpha-9.zip" target="_blank">Download MOST Executable Jar</a></p>
	<p align=center><a href="MOST_v2_alpha-9.tar.gz" target="_blank">Download MOST for Linux</a></p>
	<p align=center><a href="https://github.com/desmondlun/MOST">Download MOST Source Code from GitHub Repository</a></p>

	<p><a href="http://ecoli.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">E. coli consensus model</a> (Smallbone, 2013) has been added to the Model Collection. A few reactions and metabolites have been added to the visualization database.</p>

	<p>You must have Java version 1.7 or greater installed on your computer before running MOST. Click 
	<a href="https://java.com/en/download/help/version_manual.xml" target="_blank">here</a> for
	instructions on determining if Java is installed.
	Java can be downloaded from this <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>

	<p>MOST executable jar can be used for Windows and Macintosh. 
	Extract the zip into a folder and double-click the MOST.jar file to run MOST.
	To use the <a href="select_solvers.html">Ipopt</a> solver with Macintosh,
	<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries#MacOS">GFortran</a> needs to be installed.
	See <a href="installing_most.html">Instructions for Installing MOST</a> for further instructions on setting
	up your system to run MOST.</p>

	<p>Gurobi 6.5.2 is the minimum version of Gurobi that can be used by MOST Version 2.0 alpha-6 and later releases. Click 
	<a href="installing_most.html#issues">here</a>
	for instructions on setting up Gurobi on Windows.</p>

	<br>

	<p>If the error message below is displayed when starting up MOST:

	<p align="center"><img src ="images/launch_error.jpg" alt="Image - Launch Error" border="0"></p>

	<p>click OK to close the error message and start MOST. When the program appears,
	click Options -> Set GLPK Properties (Alt+O then Alt+L), then click the "Reset to Defaults" button (Alt+R) then click the OK button (Alt+O or Enter).
	The error message will no longer be displayed.</p>

	<p>If a message that starts with <b>"Click Options to select other solvers and suppress Gurobi solver error below."</b> 
	appears in the console when MOST is launched, the most likely cause is that Gurobi is installed but the license is 
	expired. Gurobi will not work. Please select other solvers in the <a href="select_solvers.html">Select Solvers</a> dialog.</p>
