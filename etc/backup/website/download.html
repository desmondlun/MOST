	<br>

	<p>MOST executable jar can be used for Macintosh. 
	Extract the zip into a folder and double-click the MOST.jar file to run MOST.
	To use the <a href="select_solvers.html">Ipopt</a> solver with Macintosh,
	<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries#MacOS">GFortran</a> needs to be installed.</p>

	<p>If the Windows installer does not work due to Windows protections or is blocked by other program, the Executable Jar zip file
	can be downloaded. Extract the zip into a folder and double-click the MOST.jar file to run MOST. Windows 8 is
	known to have issues with using the installer.</p>

	<br>

	<p><a name="java">Java Version 7 must be installed in order to run MOST. Java can be installed at 
	<a href="http://java.com/download">java.com/download</a>. This is unnecessary for Macintosh since 
	Java is included in the installation package.</p>
	<p>How to determine if Java is installed and what version:</p>
	<p>Windows 7 - Control Panel:</p>
	<blockquote>Change the View Category to either Large Icons or Small Icons and locate the Java icon.
	(If there is no Java icon, Java is not installed.) Click on the icon or the word "Java" and then click on the 
	About button. If the About Java box says "Version 7", the correct version of Java is installed.</blockquote>

	<p>Windows XP - Control Panel:</p>

	<blockquote>Same as above but no need to change the View.</blockquote>
	
	<p>Windows 7 or XP - Command Line:</p>
	<blockquote>Open a command window and type:</blockquote>

	<blockquote><tt>java -version</tt></blockquote>

	<blockquote>The output will look something like this:</blockquote>

	<blockquote><tt>java version "1.7.0_45"</tt></blockquote>

	<blockquote>If the version starts with 1.7 the correct version of Java is installed.</blockquote>

	<p>Linux:</p>

	<blockquote>Open a terminal and type:</blockquote>

	<blockquote><tt>java -version</tt></blockquote>

	<blockquote>The output will look something like this:</blockquote>

	<blockquote><tt>java version "1.7.0_45"</tt></blockquote>

	<blockquote>If the version starts with 1.7 the correct version of Java is installed.</blockquote>
