CURRENT VERSION: 7.5

three versions of the network are made available
* yeast_x.yz.xml, a model for use in flux analyses, in FBC format [http://sbml.org/Community/Wiki/SBML_Level_3_Proposals/Flux_Constraints]
* yeast_x.yz_cobra.xml, the same model, in Cobra format [http://opencobra.sf.net/]
* yeast_x.yz_recon.xml, a reconstruction containing only reactions for which there is experimental
evidence

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHECKSUM

maximal growth rate: 0.0947 flux units

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONVERSION SBML TO TEXT FILE

can be performed for example using the Cobra toolbox and commands

>> model = readCbModel('yeast_x.yz_cobra.xml',inf);
>> writeCbModel(model,'text','yeast_x.yz.txt');

though this is not recommended as semantic annotations may be lost.

- L-aminoadipate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase [r_0678] requires ATP [DOI:10.1039/A801345D]
- include reaction for citrate to cis-aconitate in cytosol [r_0303] [doi:10.1091/mbc.E04-11-1028]
- changed proton stoichiometry for cytochrome oxidase [r_0438] [DOI:10.1099/mic.0.050039-0] and for ubiquinol cytochrome-c reductase [r_0439] [PMID:2164001]

* gene associations in disjunctive normal form (DNF)

yeast 7.11: 16 Jan 2014
* aspartate transport [r_1117] can only flow in cytoplasm to mitochondria direction, to avoid free generation of proton gradient
* contributor: Hnin Aung
