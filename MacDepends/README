This document goes over a quick briefing of how to build a mac distributable of MOST.

====
PREREQUISITES
====

Command line tools are necessary to use many of the terminal commands necessary to build MOST's dependencies. The URL (as of 12/2015) to download them can be found here: https://developer.apple.com/downloads/
It is also adviced to use git for version control to save workspaces so that if anything breaks, you are able to return to the previous histories.

====
GLPK
====

MOST uses a java interface to GLPK linear solver. The sources can be found here: http://glpk-java.sourceforge.net/
To build GLPK-java, first make sure GLPK is first installed. Then, run the following commands:
--
./configure \
CPPFLAGS=-I/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Headers \
SWIGFLAGS=-I/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Headers

make

make install
--

This will build the mac dependencies necessary to distribute MOST.

====
JIPOPT
====

A java interface of the IPopt nonlinear solver is used in conjunction with the solver. The sources can be found here: http://www.coin-or.org/download.html
Should you choose to build the library from sources, make sure gcc (or clang) and gfortran is installed, as well as the commandline tools and any other dependency (see the Ipopt README for details). A simple ./configure, make, make install, should build the necessary binaries for distribution.

====
DYLIBS
====

Should you have problems with bundling the dependencies when building from sources (both GLPK-Java or JIpopt), you can use the attached mac dylib bundler library to resolve install names for the dynamic library loader. However, it's adviced not to do this, and instead to compile all libraries with the gcc -install-name option (see: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/DynamicLibraries/100-Articles/RunpathDependentLibraries.html) to instruct the dynamic loader to use a relative path to create portable binaries that resolve dependencies using relative pathnames. However, should there be any problems witht his, install_name_tool and otool are both useful tools to resolve dependency issues. In addition, a dynamic bundler library is also provided for your convenience. Simply run 'make' to build the binaries. A readme is also provided for your convenience.
